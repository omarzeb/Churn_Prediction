## Files and data description
The data folder contains the csv of the customer data
The images folder contains the pngs of the result of data analysis and classification results
The model folder contains the best trained models
The logs folder contains all the logging information
The churn_library.py is the main code which performs the EDA and classification task using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
The churn_script_logging_and_testing.py is used as a unit test file to test all the functions of the churn_library module to check if all the functions are running the way they are supposed to.
